The second utility you will build is called my-grep, a variant of the UNIX tool grep. This tool looks through a file, line by line, trying to find a user-specified search term in the line. If a line has the word within it, the line is printed out, otherwise it is not.
Here is how a user would look for the term foo in the file bar.txt:
prompt> ./my-grep foo bar.txt
this line has foo in it
so does this foolish line; do you see where?
even this line, which has barfood in it, will be printed.
